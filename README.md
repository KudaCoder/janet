# Janet

A digital assistant for home automation and environmental control for my snake, Kaa!

Lots of this is still in the trial & error stage and many bugs may be present

There is likely local packages that will need to be installed to make Janet work on a new system. I will update these as and when found.


***REQUIRED***

sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential

sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
